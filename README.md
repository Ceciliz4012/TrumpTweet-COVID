# TrumpTweet-COVID
As the presidential election has just wrapped up shortly before this project, we believes it is appropriate to take a more in-depth look at one of the most crucial factors in this election, COVID. 

We realized that one representative record of the executive branch's response to the pandemic is no other than President Trump's tweets. 

We want to put this (almost) real-time indicator of federal government response against the covid case curve and see whether some relationship exists between them. 

Ultimately, we are hoping to conclude certain features of the tweets are correlated to some change in covid cases before, 
or particular characteristics in tweets may lead to an increase/reduction in cases.

One source is a trump tweet dataset from “thetrumparchive.com”, which includes critical tweets that the President has deleted.
Secondly, we will use the covid dataset from JHU, which has US daily COVID case/death counts by county at https://www.thetrumparchive.com/faq https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university
